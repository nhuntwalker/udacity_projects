## About

The directories in this repository are the end-results of projects done toward the completion of the [Udacity nanodegree in Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). Each project including code and summary is visible as either an iPython notebook, or some form of HTML output. Descriptions of each project are as follows:

### Project 0: Chopsticks
- Languages/Skills: Statistics, Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, iPython Notebook, matplotlib

This project uses some data generated by a simple experiment on optimal chopstick length to illustrate some basic uses of Python and statistics.

### Project 1: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
- Languages/Skills: Statistics, Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, iPython Notebook, matplotlib, Numpy

Analysis of the Stroop effect using descriptive statistics to provide an intuition about the data, and inferential statistics to draw a conclusion based on the results.

### Project 2: Analyzing the New York Subway Dataset
- Languages/Skills: Statistics, Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, iPython Notebook, ggplot, Numpy, Scipy, statsmodels

Used data science techniques including data wrangling, applied statistics,  machine learning, and effective visualization to answer questions and draw conclusions about subway and weather data for New York City.

### Project 3: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data
- Languages/Skills: Python, XML, MongoDB, JSON, regex
- Libraries/Frameworks: iPython Notebook, pymongo

Assessed a portion of the Austin, TX OpenStreetMap data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity and then cleaned up problems found in the data.
