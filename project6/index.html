            </h2>
            <p>
                <a href=""><em>PISA</em></a> is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
            </p>
            <p> 
                The <em>PISA</em> survey spans 65 countries and provides something of a standard metric  against which countries can measure themselves for performance in mathematics, reading, and science across grade levels 7-12. What follows is a dive into the performance of the United States of America with respect to other countries in the world.
